# Student Mental Health

Mental Health Analysis is a data-driven endeavor that seeks to analyze the mental health of students in various departments and the mental health disorders prevalent based on historical data and various influencing factors. This project involves collecting and preprocessing data, conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights, developing predictive models, and evaluating their performance, with the goal of improving mental health by knowing regions that seek attention and disorders that need more help.
Good mental health positively impacts a student's ability to focus, concentrate, and perform well academically. When mental health suffers, it can lead to difficulties in learning and retaining information.
